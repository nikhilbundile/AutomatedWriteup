Automated writeup for market estimation tables.

This is a personal project which was born through my enthusiasm for advanced excel. This template compares all the values from a market estimation tables and returns largest value from base year, its corresponding segment name, forecast value, and CAGR. The template is made using complex INDEX MATCH formulae. This project is not proprietary to any organization and my personal creation.
